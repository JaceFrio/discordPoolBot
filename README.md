# discordPoolBot
discordPoolBot is a Discord bot that can has commands to assist with irl pool games.

# Commands
The bot has 2 commands:
- /piraterules: Teaches users how to play the game.
- /pirate: Starts a game of pirate.

# How It Works:
When the command /pirate is started players have 30 seconds to react with the üëç emoji to join the game session (the first emoji provided by the bot for convenience). Once all of the players have joined the bot randomly selects an equal amount balls for the players depending on how many joined. Images of the player's pool balls are then sent as a direct message to the players and then the game can start in person.

# What Is Pirate?
This game goes by many names but me and my friends call it Pirate.
Pirate is a game where an equal amount of balls are distributed to players at random (commonly drawn from ripped up pieces of paper in some guy's hat). The goal of the game is knock out everyone else's balls and have the last balls standing on the table. You don't want people knowing which balls are you own.
